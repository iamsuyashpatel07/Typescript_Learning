# Setup React Typescript Project

```cli

E:\Learning\typescript\day3>npx create-react-app react-typescript-demo --template typescript

```

# Points to remember

- If jsx or js file be written then app will break.
- Use **types** while building application and use **Interfaces** while building libraries
- import React wherever ReactNode are used in that file its necessity to react version =<16 (lower or equal to).

- For Complex State (complex state means where one state depend on other state) there useReducer is better than UseState
